### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm John!

**About me:**

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about creating efficient, user-friendly, and scalable applications. I have a unique background in the restaurant industry, where I developed strong problem-solving, communication, and time-management skills. However, I decided to pivot my career and pursue my passion for technology.

Previously, I completed my associate's degree in culinary arts, which taught me the importance of attention to detail, precision, and creativity, skills that translate well to software engineering.

Not long ago, I completed the Microsoft AZ-900 certificate, which gave me a solid foundation in cloud computing and the Azure ecosystem. Moreover, I'm graduating from Coding Temple in about a month, where I have gained hands-on experience in full-stack web development, including Flask, React, and PostgreSQL.

In my spare time, I like to play disc golf, build and paint warhammer 40k minis, play video games, learn new technologies, see live music, among many other things.
